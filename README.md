# A-Benchmark-for-Road-Abandoned-Object-Detection-from-Video-Surveillance

We proposed a large-scale road abandoned object dataset from surveillance perspective.

At present, we only released 1000 images and labels for object detection task, and other data will be updated and uploaded gradually.

Released dataset can be seen in Baidu Netdisk.
